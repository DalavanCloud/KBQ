**KBQ is a tool that helps you to perfom quality analysis on any Knowledge Base(KB) using four quality characteristics based on temporal analysis.**
- *Analysis* We use basic statistics (i.e. counts, and diffs) over extracted triples from various KB releases to measure quality characteristics. More specifically, we compute the frequency of predicate and the frequency of entities of a given resource type, and we compare the frequencies with the ones observed in previous releases.
