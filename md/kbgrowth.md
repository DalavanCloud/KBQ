We can measure growth level of KB resources (in-stances) by measuring changes over the different re-leases.  In  particular,  knowledge  base  growth  can  be measured by detecting the changes over KB releases utilizing trend analysis such as the use of simple linear regression. Based on the comparison between observed and predicted values, we can detect the trend inthe KB resources, thus detecting anomalies over KB releases if the resources have a down ward trend over the releases
